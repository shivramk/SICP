SICP
====

My solutions to SICP (Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs) 
exercises. 

The exercises were tested with [Chicken Scheme](http://http://www.call-cc.org/). They should also work with [Racket](http://racket-lang.org/).

If you are running Chicken Scheme, copy the `.csirc` file from this repo to your home directory.

If you are using Racket add the following line to the top of each source file

`#lang planet neil/sicp`
