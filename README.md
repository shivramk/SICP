SICP
====

My solutions to SICP (Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs)
exercises.

The exercises were tested with [Chicken Scheme](http://www.call-cc.org/).
They should also work with [Racket](http://racket-lang.org/).

If you are running Chicken Scheme, copy the `.csirc` file from this repo to your home directory.

If you are using Racket add the following line to the top of each source file

`#lang planet neil/sicp`

### Requirements for compiling the solutions into book form

1. Pandoc
2. Latex
3. Ghostscript
4. ImageMagick
5. Chicken Scheme
6. GNU Make

Most of the above can be installed with Homebrew if you are on a mac.
