For the purpose of illustration let the symbols be chosen from characters
`A` to `Z` in descending order of the frequency. 

![The tree for $n=5$](Chapter2/images/E2_71_1)

For such tress with $n$ symbols the number of bits required to encode the most
frequent symbol is $1$ and the number of bits required to encode the least
frequent symbol is $n-1$.
