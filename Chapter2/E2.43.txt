Louis Reasoners has interchanged the order of the nested map. Instead of
computing (queen-cols (-k 1)) once and iterting over 1 to boardsize, the 
(queen-cols (-k 1)) will now get computed board size times. 

For (queens 8) this means that (queen-cols (-k 1)) gets computed 8 times
in each call to queen-cols. If the original version takes time T then the new
version will roughly take

      T(new) = 8 * 8 * 8 ... (8 times) * T
             = 8 ^ 8 T

Although this isn't exactly correct because there are other computations in 
there whose runtime depends on the value of k.
