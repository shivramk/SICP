Let each interval $i$ be represented by the pair $(l, u)$ where $l$ is the 
lower bound and $u$ is the upper bound.

Let the center be defined as $c = \frac{(u+l)}{2}$ and the tolerance factor 
as $f = \frac{(u-c)}{c}$

Consider the multiplication of two intervals $i_1=(x-d_1, x + d_1)$ and
$i_2=(y-d_2, y-d_2)$ where $x$ is the center of $i_1$ and $d_1 = f_1 * x$, and
$y$ is the center of $i_2$ and $d_2 = f_2 * y$. We assume that all values are
positive.

$$
\begin{aligned}
i_1*i_2 &= (xy - xd_2 - yd_1 + d_1d_2, xy + xd_2 + y_d1 + d_1d_2) \\
\end{aligned}
$$

Now consider the center of the product
$$
\begin{aligned}
c &= \frac{u+l}{2} \\
  & = \frac{xy - xd_2 - yd_1 + d_1d_2 + xy + xd_2 + y_d1 + d_1d_2}{2} \\ 
  & = \frac{2xy + 2d_1d_2}{2} \\
  & = xy + d_1d_2
\end{aligned}
$$

The percentage factor will be
$$
\begin{aligned}
f &= \frac{(u-c)}{c} \\
  & = \frac{xy + xd_2 + yd_1 + d_1d_2 - xy -d_1d_2}{xy + d_1d_2} \\
  & = \frac{xd_2 + yd_1}{xy + d_1d_2}
\end{aligned}
$$

Given that the tolerances are small the product $d_1d_2$ can be ignored.
$$
\begin{aligned}
f &= \frac{xd_2}{xy} + \frac{yd_1}{xy} \\
  & = \frac{d_2}{y} + \frac{d_1}{x} \\
f & = f_2 + f_1
\end{aligned}
$$

Therefore, for small tolerances the percentage tolerance of the product
approximately equals the sum of the percentage tolerances of the factors.
