Louis Reasoners has interchanged the order of the nested map. Instead of
computing `(queen-cols (-k 1))` once and iterating over 1 to `board-size`, the
`(queen-cols (-k 1))` will now get computed `board-size` times.

For `(queens 8)` this means that `(queen-cols (-k 1))` gets computed 8 times
in each call to queen-cols. If the original version takes time $T$ then the new
version will roughly take

$$
\begin{aligned}
      T(new) &= 8 \cdot 8 \cdot 8\ ...\ (8\ times) \cdot T \\
             &= 8 ^ 8 \cdot T
\end{aligned}
$$

Although this isn't exactly correct because there are other computations in
there whose runtime depends on the value of `k`.
