In the applicative order

    (gcd 206 40)
    (gcd 40 (remainder 206 40))
    (gcd 40 6)
    (gcd 6 (remainder 40 6))
    (gcd 6 4)
    (gcd 4 (remainder 6 4))
    (gcd 4 2)
    (gcd 2 (remainder 4 2))
    (gcd 2 0)

There are 4 remainder operations performed.

The normal order will be the same as the applicative order because the if
condition will force the remainder operation to be performed.
