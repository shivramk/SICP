(define (expmod base exp m)
   (remainder (fast-expt base exp) m))

The procedure expmod is actually optimized for performing the fermat test, 
in that it takes the modulo at each step of the exponentiation. This means
that the result at any stage can only be as large as `m`. 

The fast-expt procedure on the other hand is a generic exponentiation procedure
and will compture the result first (however big). This might give us problems
because the result may be too large for the system to handle (in scheme systems
with limited precision). Even in scheme implementations will arbitrary precision
the fast-expt procedure will certainly take longer than expmod.

So in the case of the fermat test the expmod procdure is the right choice.
