### Complexity Analysis (Space)

The maximum recursion depth will be reached with coins of denomination 1.
Assuming the amount is n, space growth will be $O(n)$ as there will be recursive
calls with amount $n, n-1, n-2\ ...$ all the way up to $0$.

### Complexity Analysis (Time)

1. In the base case with coins of a single denomination it is easy to see that
   the steps will be proportional to the amount i.e O(n).

2. With coins of two denominations, the number of steps will be roughly
   equal to

    $O(n) + O(n-k) + O(n-2k) + ...\ (n/k\ times)$

    Which is nothing but $O(n^2)$

3. We can extrapolate from here and reach the conclusion that the number of
   steps will be $O(n^k)$
