TODO
====

1.24 - Profile the code to see why fast-prime? Is actually slower than the
       other prime function.
2.16 - This is apparently a very difficult problem. Attempt this later.

Miscellaneous
-------------

1. Refer to images across all formats (pdf, epub, html)
2. Add test cases
3. Remove any duplicate code from 2.75-2.83. Look at 2.84 for inspiration
