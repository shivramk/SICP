TODO
====

1.14 - Use graphwhiz to generate call tree.
1.24 - Profile the code to see why fast-prime? Is actually slower than the
       other prime function.
2.16 - This is apparently a very difficult problem. Attempt this later.
2.24 - Add labels to box and pointer notation (Refer to page 108 of SICP).

Miscellaneous
-------------

1. Write the build script in chicken-scheme
2. Convert remaining latex files into pandoc markdown
3. Process source code and use comments for generating markdown
4. Add test cases
