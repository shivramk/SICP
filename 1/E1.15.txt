Code given is as follows

(define (cube x) (* x x x))

(define (p x) (- (* 3 x) (* 4 (cube x))))

(define (sine angle)
  (if (not (> (abs angle) 0.1))
    angle
    (p (sine (/ angle 3.0)))))

a. The procedure p is applied 5 times when (sine 12.15) is called. 

b. Consider the case of (sine 12.15). The sine process will keep dividing the 
   angle by 3 till it becomes < 0.1

   In this case the values of angle will be 
   12.15 -> 4.05 -> 1.35 -> 0.45 -> 0.15 -> 0.05

   let v = 0.05, s be number of steps (5 here), and n be 12.15
   
   v * 3 ^ s = n
   log3(3^s) = log3(n/v)
           s = log3(n/v)
  
   v is a constant and can be ignored which makes the order of grown O(log(n))

   The order of growth is same in both time and space
